Items are actors that may be used and / interacted with.

This includes:
 * map items - ie. a mineable resource or flippable switch
 * player items - ie. a nuke or non-character interaction (satelite etc)
 * character items - ie. a med pack or stimpack

In many cases Items are unexpected things as well:
 * map items - ie. a fire left by a flamethrower or a pool of acid left by aliens
 * player items - ie. a building to be placed
 * character items - ie. equipment or resources being carried

Sometimes it makes sense to combine these with a crafting like utility:
 * map items - ie. using a fire extinguisher's fog to put out a map fire
 * player items - ie. research alchemy (combining different research to form new ones)
 * character items - ie. add turrets to a ship
